## Overview
### Description
Dogify is the dog version of Spotify(well kinda), but rather than it consisting of music, it will be sound effects oriented. Users will be able to select and play from a wide selection of sound effects for their dogs in the hopes of sparking a captured and lasting reaction out of them.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category: Activities/ Lifestyle
- **Mobile:** This app is designed for mobile users.
- **Story:** Dogify will become an everyday bonding activity that allows users to enage more frequently with their dogs and find interest in the dog's behavior.  
- **Market:** The target market would be any dog owner   looking to capture a meaningful interaction with their dog.
- **Habit:** In the occasion where everytime a user wants to gain their dog's attention and/or recieve a reaction through sound effects, they would use this app.
- **Scope:** V1 is the pool of sound effects where users can choose from. V2 would be a camera feature allowing users to capture their dogs reaction while using the sound effect. V3 would be allowing users to save their video within the app and/or to their built in camera app. V4 would allow users to upload the video to other social media platforms.
